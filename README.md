# API-Employee-Directory
An employee directory that shares information by communicating with a Random user Generator API. It makes a fetch request(using **JavaScript**) and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid(design and sytle with **HTML** and **CSS**) with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
